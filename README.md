The project involves the development of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of house data for analysis. The pipeline is designed to process real estate datasets, which include information on house prices, property features, and locations, from multiple sources such as APIs, CSV files, and databases. By leveraging Airflow, the system orchestrates the scheduling and execution of ETL tasks, ensuring that the data is efficiently cleaned, transformed, and loaded into a database for further analysis.
In the extraction phase, data is gathered from various sources and pre-processed to handle missing values and standardize formats. During the transformation phase, the data undergoes cleaning, feature engineering, and aggregation to prepare it for analysis. The final phase involves loading the transformed data into a structured data warehouse, enabling easy querying and reporting. The system uses Apache Airflow to automate task execution, monitor job success, and handle errors, ensuring a seamless workflow.
The output of the project is a robust and scalable ETL pipeline that enables automated processing of house data, providing accurate and timely insights into housing trends, pricing strategies, and real estate market analysis. By automating the data pipeline, the project significantly reduces manual effort and increases the efficiency and reliability of data processing.
The project is deployed using AWS S3 service for data storage, and the processed data is visualized using Amazon QuickSight or Tableau, enabling insightful and interactive real estate market analysis.
